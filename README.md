<!-- Project Description -->
## Project Description

Gesture Control Vehicle is a project centered around the concept of intuitive vehicle control. It leverages gesture-based interactions, employing specially crafted gloves equipped with accelerometers to enable real-time control of vehicles through a WiFi connection. The integration of robust WiFi connectivity ensures swift and responsive communication between the glove and the vehicle, even in environments where internet access may be scarce or unavailable.

<!-- Key Features -->
## Key Features

- Gesture-based control of a vehicle using an accelerometer-equipped glove.
- Wireless communication via Wi-Fi for remote vehicle control.
- Utilization of the ESP32 microcontroller for processing and communication.
- Intuitive user interface with real-time visual feedback on the vehicle's status.

<!-- Technical Focus -->
## Technical Focus

This project goes beyond the conventional and delves deep into the realms of low-level programming. We harness the power of C and assembly language, working directly with microcontroller registers, to ensure precise and efficient control. The project also involves the creation of detailed schematics, simulations, and comprehensive documentation for each component used.

<!-- Key Elements -->
## Key Elements

- **C Programming**: The project relies on the use of C programming to develop firmware that communicates with the ESP32 microcontroller, facilitating seamless interaction with the vehicle.
- **Assembly Language**: To achieve fine-grained control and optimization, we utilize assembly language to program microcontroller registers, allowing us to extract the utmost performance from the hardware.
- **Schematics**: Comprehensive schematics are created to visualize the electronic connections and component layout, offering a clear understanding of the project's hardware architecture.
- **Simulations**: Prior to hardware assembly, simulations are employed to verify the system's functionality and address potential issues.
- **Component Documentation**: Every component used in the project is thoroughly documented, providing valuable insights into their specifications, connections, and usage.

This project represents an exciting fusion of hardware and software, combining cutting-edge technology with a deep dive into the intricacies of microcontroller programming and electronics. It serves as an educational journey that not only enables gesture-based vehicle control but also equips participants with invaluable skills in embedded systems development.

<!-- Future Implementation -->
## Future Implementation

An exciting future enhancement is the integration of an ESPcam for real-time visualization of the vehicle's direction via Wi-Fi. This addition will provide users with immediate visual feedback, further enhancing the control experience.

<!-- Contribution -->
## Contribution

Currently, this project is limited to collaboration from students of the Embedded Microprocessed Systems course. In the near future, we plan to open the project to contributions from others. Stay tuned for updates on when external participation will be possible.
